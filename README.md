# Clone And Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `django` framework of `python` and that's why we need `python` and `pip` installed.
- While installing `python`, try to install version `3.7+` which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned and make sure `pip` is installed along side with it You can check boxes for installing `pip` while installing `python`.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page.
- After the successful installation of `python`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  - ```python
     git clone https://github.com/Kshatriya770/Grocery-Store.git
    ```
  - This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  - ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Some of the required dependencies will be downloaded to your system.
- Now, the project is ready to use.
- You can check it using `python manage.py runserver`, it will open the website locally on your browser.(create issue or let me know if anything happens with the SECRET KEY).
- To manage the Database you need to create a admin.
- To do so go to terminal in the directory and execute this command:
  - ```python
     python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
